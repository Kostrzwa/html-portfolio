<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Beginner Web Developer on a quest to make that developing journey way more fun, interesting and easier!</p>
<p>I have just started learning web development by myself, supported by The Amazing Angela Yu and her online life-saving bootcamp. 
  I find this learning process very exciting and rewarding and hope to learn more with each and every lesson.
  I wish to aquire skills high enough to be able to switch from my current English teaching job to a web developer position in the nearest future.</p>
  <p>As you can see, I am still a newbie, but I am driven and passionate, and have my eyes on the goal!
    I am sure that if you decide to give me a chance, you will not be disappointed!
